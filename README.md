## Lexical Grammar
Define the lexical grammar for your language, ensuring each token and its rules are
documented in a README file. Design the lexical grammar that has at least 5 different
token types.

NOTE: [A-G]
OCTAVE: [1-8]
// maybe get rid of this CHORD: Represented by [major | minor | augmented | diminished] // lowercase so it doesn't overlap with note
REST: Represented by [R] // nothing else starts with R, so if R, token will be rest?
LENGTH: [whole | half | quarter | eighth | sixteenth ] // lowercase to not clash with Note
REPEAT: Number followed by "times:"
COLON: ":"
