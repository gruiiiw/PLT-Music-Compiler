## Lexical Grammar
Define the lexical grammar for your language, ensuring each token and its rules are
documented in a README file. Design the lexical grammar that has at least 5 different
token types.

NOTE: [A-G] <br>
OCTAVE: [1-8] <br>
// maybe get rid of this CHORD: Represented by [major | minor | augmented | diminished] // lowercase so it doesn't overlap with note <br>
REST: Represented by [R] // nothing else starts with R, so if R, token will be rest? <br>
LENGTH: [ whole | half | quarter | eighth | sixteenth ] // lowercase to not clash with Note <br>
REPEAT: Number followed by "times:" <br>
COLON: ":" <br>

## Shell Script to Execute Lexer
Installation Steps <br>

** Do not assume anything. We could be running it on a system without python. The easiest way to sort out this requirement would be to add a Dockerfile with all the build steps, that can be run on any system.
